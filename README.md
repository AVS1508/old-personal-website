 <p align="justify">This repository contains my old personal résumé website (<a href="https://www.adityavsingh.com/old-personal-website" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>) which was created using Bootstrap and JavaScript. In December 2020, the transition of my personal website to a ReactJS framework was finalized, which now serves as my new personal résumé website <a href="https://www.adityavsingh.com/" target="_blank_">here</a>.</p>
